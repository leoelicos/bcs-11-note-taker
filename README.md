## Introduction

This easy-to-use note-taking application allows the user to write and save notes in order to better arrange and document memos for work or study. This application uses npm packages `express` and `uuid`, uses Express.js middleware and is deployed with Heroku. I made this app in order to learn how to use various middleware, such as express.json(), express.urlencoded and express.static, and finally mounted and unmounted middleware with express.use.

## Usage

Deployed: [Note Taker](https://leoelicos-note-taker.herokuapp.com/). Will run on a browser.
